# Tasks complete #

  - Client/Server
    - Projectiles are now synchronized across clients
    - Defined a new message type SHOOT
    - Added player rotation to MOVE messages to make remote player movement more fluid
    - Collision detection is now a thing, players and projectiles have set bounds
    - Each client now checks for collisions to it's own player
    - Add an invulnerability timer when hit by a projectile
    - Add a new message for changing player Health
    - Players hit by projectiles lose health and the health bar shortens
    - Health bar changes colour when below 66% and 33%.
    - Fix annoying bug where players near (0,0) would get hit regardless of bounds

# Tasks in progress # 

  - Client/Server
    - Finalise prototype build for demonstration

# Tasks pending #

  - Interim Report

# Comments #

This week I spent most of my time on the two features that were suggested would be good to demonstrate in the
prototype by my supervisor, namely, the synchronization of projectiles across clients and the ability to hurt
other players with those projectiles which requires some collision detection. Both are now implemented and
despite having a lot of room for improvement are enough for the prototype demonstration. Certain features such
as the shortening and changing colour of the health bar are really beneficial to the user experience and look
great. The HEALTH messaging protocol could do with a lot of work and despite it working fine for a demo there
are a lot of ways I can think of that will break it. Since it's relative there are problems where a player
might take a single damage event when they should take two, etc. This will definitely be resolved after the
interim report is handed in.
