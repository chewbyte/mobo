# Tasks complete #

  - Code
    - Allow player to change the game resolution via settings menu
    - Add smaller backgrounds and optimise them for less memory usage
    - Split the spriteBatch into two, this allows drawing of 'static' elements like UI
      and elements that scroll such as the background
    - Background now tiles over a large area (-5000,-5000) to (5000,5000)
    - Add a message list that displays system, network and player chat messages in the corner

# Tasks in progress # 

  - Server
    - Set up a simple messaging protocol

# Tasks pending #

  - Code
    - Design fortresses and develop random generation
    - Set bounds for player movement

This week was mostly devoted to getting the game camera to track the player's movement, i.e. regardless
of the position of the player, the camera will move so that the player is always in the center of the
screen. This allows creation of levels that are larger than the size of the game window, which is actually
fairly small. Also I added a parameter to the spritebatch renderer so that it can be fed any size rectangles
with a texture that is smaller than that rectangle, so that it tiles the texture over the rectangle. This
allows a large seamless background over a large area now that the game extends beyond the bounds of the window.
At some point there should be an invisible barrier that prevents players travelling too far out, but for now
it will do. I put the fortresses on hold for now as I really need to start working on the network and server.
