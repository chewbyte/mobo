This week was spent structuring and fleshing out the foundations of the project. I want
to have the menus set up first as opposed to the game itself so I have a solid foundation
to build the game on and not have to come back later on while I should be doing important
development on the networking to do trivial menu programming. It also helps me to learn
the XNA framework without jumping straight into the deep end. Menus are mostly set up now
although there is no settings to tweak, play and help turn the screen black (as there is no
draw/update code behind them) and exit does not actually exit. Spent quite a lot of time structuring the gamestates in a logical way, each state has it's own draw and update methods, and therefore are only executing while they are active.
