This week I moved the project from the XNA framework to Monogame. Monogame is very
similar in that it is built upon XNA, but isn't 'dead' and has a lot of support, whilst
being open source and free. Porting the existing code was easy and other than the content
import pipeline, every worked straight off the bat. I mainly worked on the player movement,
making sure it was as smooth as possible. I spent quite a lot of time trying to get the
player rotation correct, works quite well now but was tricky due to having to calculate
inverse tangent based upon the velocity of the ship. Also added support to shoot, and
once again it required calculating the starting rotation of the bullet (based on the
current rotation of the ship) and resultant direction the bullet travels in. Added a 200ms
limit between bullet fires.
