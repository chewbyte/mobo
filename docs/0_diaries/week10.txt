# Tasks complete #

  - Client/Server
    - List all connected players in the top right hand corner of the client when online
    - List all connected players in the server command line window
    - Optimise SHOOT messages so only the direction float is sent rather than two velocity floats

# Tasks in progress # 

  - Interim Report

# Tasks pending #

This week I spent a little time refining some features of the prototype but almost all project time on planning
and writing the interim report deliverable. In regard to the third task complete, SHOOT messages originally
had two velocity floads (essentially a vector) that defined the velocity of a bullet sent from a player.
Rather than this it is easier to send just the direction in radians of the bullet, and calculate the resultant
velocity of the projectile on the client-side, reducing the size of the message.
