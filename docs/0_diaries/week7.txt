# Tasks complete #

  - Code
    - Added LidgrenNetwork library to the project
    - Created an Online gameState with a menu button (Join Server)
    - Created a KeyboardInput class to improve reuse of keyboard functions
    - Created a command line MoboServer project within the solution
    - Specified a rough protocol for the messaging in Network.cs (header, playername, x pos, y pos)
    - Added a Player class that stores information pertaining to players in the server
    - Had the client and server transferring info at a basic level
    - Played around with TCP and UDP to see the pros and cons of each

# Tasks in progress # 

  - Server
    - Optimise the protocol (ints rather than strings where possible)
    - Set up messaging 'connect', 'move', 'disconnect'
    - Display players using their positional data

# Tasks pending #

  - Server
    - Add some system to deny access to players with the same name or IP

# Comments #

This week I begun work on the Server. The server utilises the LidgrenNetwork library to send
and recieve messages over a network. It allows me to write variables to a stream, like ints and
strings. At the moment messages have a header that is a string, this tells the server whether the
client is connecting for the first time, has moved and wants an update, or is trying to disconnect.
In the future this should be a more efficient primitive type like an int, since strings take up
more bandwidth and comparing strings is computationally more difficult than comparing ints. I also
added a Player class to the server that stores and relays certain variables to the Network, such as
positional coordinates, name and a timeout that disconnects a player automatically if they have not
been in contact with the server for a certain amount of time. Right at the end of the week I finally
got the client and server communicating with eachother and transferring basic types such as strings
and ints.
